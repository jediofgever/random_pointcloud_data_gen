## Random Labeled point cloud data generation from cad models
A ROS package for artifical point cloud dataset generation. With recent advances in Deep Learning, CNNs are able to extract and learn features from 3D data. For represnetion 3D data, Point cloud types are used(e.g pointnet).
This packages uses a simulated depth camera under Gazebo simulator to produce realistic point cloud data.

Custom objects can be imported in Gazebo world, 

## Prerequisites
ROS kinetic
Gazebo 9.0

## Installation && Usage
>git clone https://github.com/jediofgever/random_pointcloud_data_gen.git

>cd catkin_ws

>catkin_make

## Prepare your data to be trained with Pointnet[1]
coming soon.....  


#### NOTE , PROJECT IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS SO THE CODE IS QUITE MESSY FOR NOW
Feel free to open an issue If you have questions related to project
